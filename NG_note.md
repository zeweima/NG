Interesting, almost all the paper organized into three main sections, the same number as stress in Talk like TED.

### 1
- **Global groundwater warming due to climate change** Benz et al., (2024)
    ![Figure1](read\GlobalGroundwaterWarmingDueToClimateChange\Figure1.png)  
    - First impression: good looking
    - The figure give the overall strucure of the paper. For the left side: the mechanical representation of groundwater temperatrue changes to climate change. For the right side: three aspects/applications the authors want to investigate based on the mechanisms.
    - This is a conceptulized figure
    - Overall structure of the paper:
        - Opening: Lack of the focus groundwater in climate change; Narrow to temperature; Some impact of groundwater temperature, leading to the last paragraph showing the overall framework
        - Story: 1. showing the model performance and then perfromed projections; 2. Digging deeper in the mechanisms; 3. Implication for two aspects: drinking water safety and ecosystem. \<all those are very simple analysis\>

- **Global patterns in river water storage dependent on residence time** Collins et al., (2024)
    ![Figure1](read\GlobalPatternsInRiverWaterStorageDependentOnResidenceTime\Figure1.png)  
    - The first figure give the resutls of their newly make product. 整个paper感觉每太看懂

### 3
- **Megafloods in Europe can be anticipated from observations in hydrologically similar catchments**
    ![Figure1](read\MegafloodsInEuropeCanBeAnticipatedFromObservationsInHydrologicallySimilarCatchments\Figure1.png)
    - Overall, there are lots of infomation presented in this figure: a). Study region; b) The concept of envolope; c) the emerging of extreme events; d) selected watershed. e). The regional variability of envolope.
    - Then, in Figure 2, introduce the role of donor watersheds, and also show the potential of use it to predict megaflood.
    - In figure 3, further show the evidence that support using past infomation to predict.
    - In figure 4, validate the results.  
    \<**overall, it is a very smart and briant paper to leverage the watershed classification in reality**\>

### 4
- **Half of global agricultural soil phosphorus fertility derived from anthropogenic sources**
    ![alt text](read\HalfOfGlobalAgriculturalSoilPhosphorusFertilityDerivedFromAnthropogenicSources\Figure1.png)

### 5
- **Substantial contribution of tree canopy nitrifiers to nitrogen fluxes in European forests**
    ![alt text](read\SubstantialContributionOfTreeCanopyNitrifiersToNitrogenFluxesInEuropeanForests\Figure1.png)
    - Overall the first figure show geological location and the phenomena, which is the N deposition is different in bare soil and canopy.
    - Then, the store continues to partition introgen source into atmospheric depostion and canopu denitrification, as show in Figure 2. 
    - Figure 4 is a more comprehensive representation of the whole process.

### 6
- **Dominant role of soil moisture in mediating carbon and water fluxes in dryland ecosystems**  
    ![alt text](read\DominantRoleOfSoilMoistureInMediatingCarbonAndWaterFluxesInDrylandEcosystems\Figure1.png)  
    - Figure1 shows the major mechanisms in the study, and the authors widened their scope by investigating the wider application of those conclusion in 1) remote sensing product and 2) physical model
    - All other figures are used to illustrate the performance of satellite images and models in representing the discovered phenomena.
    - *I have done something, what I will do next, naturely find some implications.*

### 7
- **Extreme flooding controlled by stream network organization and flow regime**  
    ![alt text](read\ExtremeFloodingControlledByStreamNetworkOrganizationAndFlowRegime\Figure1.png)
    - Figure1 shows: 1. two kinds of watershed: with/without the occurance of large flooding. 2. One important concept, Flood divide. 
    - The overall structure of the study: 1. Describe the phenomena large flooding. 2. Associate the phenomenon with watershed properties. 3. Developing simple model to make prediction based on the asscociation. Corresponding to three figures in the maintext.
    - Similar to another flooding paper?
    - Note how the paper develops in each sub-section.  

### 8
- **Global patterns of water storage in the rooting zones of vegetation**  
    ![alt text](read\GlobalPatternsOfWaterStorageInTheRootingZonesOfVegetation\Figure1.png)
    - Figure1 shows the estiamted rooting-zone water-storage capacity from vegetation activity, which is the direct results from the method.
    - Not so easy to read, I would say.
    - Overall, the paper also tell three components in the paper. 1. Direct predictions. 2. Comparing the results with root depth information. 3. Further validate the model in different plant species.

### 9
- **Deforestation-induced warming over tropical mountain regions regulated by elevation**
    ![alt text](read\DeforestationInducedWarmingOverTropicalMountainRegionsRegulatedByElevation\Figure1.png)
    - Figure 1 basially shows the background, the prediction changes as the first part of the story.
    - The overall story flow like, 1. Identify the temperature change and it shows some spatial patterns. 2. Distinction in highland and lowland. 3. Then, look into more detailed classification, elevation. 4. at last, investage the effects of ET and albedo on this.

### 10
- **Widespread increases in soluble phosphorus concentrations in streams across the transboundary Great Lakes Basin**
    ![alt text](read\WidespreadIncreasesInSolublehosphorusConcentrationsInStreamsAcrossTheTransboundaryGreatLakesBasin\Figure1.png) 
    - The first figure shows the SRP and TP concentration over the space.
    - Then, the story advances to the change of the trend of SRP and TP.
    - Attribution analysis are perfroms to understanding the role of watershed features to the change trend.
    - Ending with future implications
